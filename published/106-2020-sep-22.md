## Space Race 2: Slingshot - put your project on Filecoin for FIL token rewards!
Following [Space Race 1](https://spacerace.filecoin.io/), a competition for storage miners that resulted in 230PiB onboarded to the Filecoin testnet, Protocol Labs announced Space Race 2: Slingshot, a competition for the community of developers excited to use all this storage! Developers who integrate an application with and store useful data on Filecoin‚Äôs testnet can be eligible for potentially large Filecoin token rewards. We‚Äôd love to have as many developers from the IPFS community as possible participating - eligible integrations can be as simple as using a tool like [Textile‚Äôs Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/) to back up data your project is already storing on IPFS to Filecoin. Competition details can be found [here](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-sr2-slingshot/)!
